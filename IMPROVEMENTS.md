**Time taken:** <Let us know how many hours and minutes you spent on this task, including writing your improvements>

There are quite a few improvements intentionally left out of the codebase for you to write about. This is your chance to show off your thinking and we would love to hear your thoughts around making this a production system. 

The improvements could be wide ranging touching on, for example:
* The code in general, as well as
    * The readability
    * The testability
    * The maintainability
* Monitoring and observability
* CICD
* Infrastructure
* System design
* Security
* Or anything else you would like

Remember, if you are suggesting an improvement you need to include your justification and tradeoffs.

Software engineering is about communicating with people more than it is about writing instructions for machines. Feel free to submit your improvements in the way that suits you. It could be written, or you could provide a link to a video (e.g. loom) if you like to explain with a whiteboard and video.
